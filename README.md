# KillerJS

Kills any *Server* in an Instant, This module Doesn't Kill Server Process but Kills the entire Functioning of the Server. It's essentially a kill-switch for those scammers out there who get the work done by Developers but Don't pay or Block. 

## Use it with Caution

I'm not responsible if you destroy your PC or Somehting, It's just made for the Developers who get scammed by Clients and Hence can destroy their Server for The Damage Caused to them and their Code.

Please Use it with Caution and I do-not recommend using it on your own pc or even a Server. Try it on a Virtual Machine, if you want to but Never Use it with your Main Computer.
